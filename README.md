# Comparison of selected data mining algorithms and their computational complexity

This thesis is concerned with comparing of time complexity and space complexity of selected data mining algorithms.The objective of the theoretical part is to provide an introduction to machine learning algorithms and a detailed analysis of the algorithm complexity problematics. The following part presents a selection of the most commonly used data mining algorithms and reasons for this selection.The practical part concentrates on comparing theoretical complexity of the selected algorithms with their measured values on both real and synthetic data.The output of this thesis is a graphical presentation of the test results, comparison and interpretation of these results and recommendation regarding the suitability of selected algorithms for the given type of task.
